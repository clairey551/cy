        <h1>Hi, I'm Claire.</h1>
        <p>
            Hi, I'm Claire Yang and I make things. I'm a rising freshman at the Academy for Information Technology, a public magnet high school in New Jersey. 
            I'm currently at Edison Intermediate School, where I won the National Council of Teachers of English Young Writers First Class award, and the only one in my state where you have to be nominated by teachers.
            I'm also a two-time 2023 Scholastic Art and Writing Gold Key winner for my flash fiction pieces.
            I love to create things and tackle new projects--- this website is being coded in VS Studio Code, and currently, I'm 13 years old. I love learning new things and maintaining my Duolingo streak.
            I love running--- I run track and field and cross country, and sometimes I wake up at 6:30 in the morning to do it. 
            Finally, I'm an avid reader + writer. I always have a book that I'm reading, and I want to write my own novel by the beginning of freshman year :)
